The file gives the template, how to pass User parameters to my code.
Doing this as I faced an issue, that the database generates different
names for my columns, not as these in the code.
Don't know why is it so, perhaps you will explane me.
This attachment is relevant for the 2nd stage as well.
The template looks as follows:

{
	"login":"your login",
	"firstName":"your first name",
	"lastName":"your last name",
	"dateOfBirth":"1999-03-03",
	"isActive": true/false
}
